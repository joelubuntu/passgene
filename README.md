It generate random 10 digits password and you can save it.
This python script generate random 10 digit password. 
since the password is generated is a bit complex you can save this password file.
password file is saved with .txt extension.
don't modify or rename the else view_pass function won't work
password file is saved in the same folder where the python file is saved
Thank you :)
